{caption}## Your objective

I want you to annotate the given trajectory with reasoning. That is, for each step, I need to know not only {
break_line}which action should be chosen, but importantly what reasoning justifies that action choice. I want you to {
break_line}be descriptive and include all the relevant information available. The reasoning should include the task {
break_line}to complete, the remaining high-level steps, the high-level movements that should be executed and why they {
break_line}are required, the premises that allow inferring the direction of each move, including the locations of {
break_line}relevant objects, possible obstacles or difficulties to avoid, and any other relevant justification.

### Begin by describing the task

Start by giving an overview of the task. Make it more comprehensive than the simple instruction. Include the activity, {
break_line}the objects the robotic arm interacts with, and their relative locations in the environment. Then, describe {
break_line}the high-level movements that were most likely executed, based on the task that was completed and the {
break_line}primitive movements that were executed. Then, for each high-level movement write the interval of steps that {
break_line}movement consists of. Also, for each high-level movement write a justification for why it should be {
break_line}executed. Write an answer for this part using markdown and natural language. Be descriptive and highlight {
break_line}all the relevant details, but ensure that your description is consistent with the trajectory that was {
break_line}executed, specified by the features listed above in the `trajectory_features` dictionary.

### List the reasonings for each step

Finally, for each step describe the reasoning that allows to determine the correct action. For each step describe the {
break_line}remaining part of the objective, the current progress, the objects that are still relevant for determining {
break_line}the plan, and the plan for the next steps, based on the available features. Start the reasoning from a high {
break_line}level and gradually add finer features. I need you to be descriptive and very precise. Ensure that the {
break_line}reasoning is consistent with the task and the executed trajectory. Write the answer for this part as a {
break_line}Python-executable dictionary. For every step in the initial trajectory there should be exactly one separate {
break_line}item of the form <step id>:<reasoning>. Do not group the answers. The final dictionary should have exactly {
break_line}the same set of integer keys as the dictionary of features provided in the `trajectory_features` dictionary {
break_line}above. The reasoning should be a single string that describes the reasoning in natural language and {
break_line}includes all the required features.

Each reasoning string should have the following form:
- Describe the full task that remains to be completed (but only describe what remains), and place it inside a {
break_line}tag <task>.
- Describe the complete high-level plan for completing the remaining task (the list of remaining high-level steps), {
break_line}and place it inside a tag <plan>.
- Describe the high-level step that should be executed now (chosen from the list of high-level steps), and place it {
break_line}inside a tag <subtask>.
- Describe why the chosen high-level step should be executed now, which features of the current environment influence {
break_line}that decision, and how it should be done. Place it within a tag <subtask_reason>.
- Describe the current primitive movement of the arm that needs to be executed, and place it inside a tag <move>.
- Describe why the chosen movement should be executed now and which features of the current environment influence that {
break_line}decision. Place it inside a tag <move_reason>.

## Task summary

Here is a breakdown of what needs to be done:

- Describe the task.
- Describe the high-level movements that were executed, based on the completed task and the listed features.
- Describe the plan for the solution that allowed the robot to complete the task successfully.
- For each step on the trajectory, describe the reasoning that leads to determining the correct action. The reasoning {
break_line}should be descriptive and precise. You should provide exactly one reasoning string for each step on the {
break_line}trajectory specified by `trajectory_features`.
- At the very end of the response, write a single label FINISHED to indicate that the answer is complete."""
