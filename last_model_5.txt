# Annotate the training trajectory with reasoning

You must output a Python dictionary with the following structure:

```python
{
  0: "<task>...</task><plan>...</plan><subtask>...</subtask><subtask_reason>...</subtask_reason><move>...</move><move_reason>...</move_reason>",
  1: "...",
  ...
}
```

Each value must be a string including exactly these 6 XML-style tags. No explanation outside the dictionary. End with:
```
FINISHED
```

Each entry in that dictionary corresponds to a single step on the trajectory and describes the move that is about to be executed.

## Your objective

I want you to annotate the given trajectory with reasoning. That is, for each step, I need to know not only which action should be chosen, but importantly what reasoning justifies that action choice. I want you to be descriptive and include all the relevant information available. The reasoning should include the task to complete, the remaining high-level steps, the high-level movements that should be executed and why they are required, the premises that allow inferring the direction of each move, including the locations of relevant objects, possible obstacles or difficulties to avoid, and any other relevant justification.

### Begin by describing the task

Start by giving an overview of the task. Make it more comprehensive than the simple instruction. Include the activity, the objects the robotic arm interacts with, and their relative locations in the environment. Then, describe the high-level movements that were most likely executed, based on the task that was completed and the primitive movements that were executed. Then, for each high-level movement write the interval of steps that movement consists of. Also, for each high-level movement write a justification for why it should be executed. Write an answer for this part using markdown and natural language. Be descriptive and highlight all the relevant details, but ensure that your description is consistent with the trajectory that was executed, specified by the features listed above in the `trajectory_features` dictionary.

### List the reasonings for each step

Finally, for each step describe the reasoning that allows to determine the correct action. For each step describe the remaining part of the objective, the current progress, the objects that are still relevant for determining the plan, and the plan for the next steps, based on the available features. Start the reasoning from a high level and gradually add finer features. I need you to be descriptive and very precise. Ensure that the reasoning is consistent with the task and the executed trajectory. Write the answer for this part as a Python-executable dictionary. For every step in the initial trajectory there should be exactly one separate item of the form <step id>:<reasoning>. Do not group the answers. The final dictionary should have exactly the same set of integer keys as the dictionary of features provided in the `trajectory_features` dictionary above. The reasoning should be a single string that describes the reasoning in natural language and includes all the required features.

Each reasoning string should have the following form:
- Describe the full task that remains to be completed (but only describe what remains), and place it inside a tag <task>.
- Describe the complete high-level plan for completing the remaining task (the list of remaining high-level steps), and place it inside a tag <plan>.
- Describe the high-level step that should be executed now (chosen from the list of high-level steps), and place it inside a tag <subtask>.
- Describe why the chosen high-level step should be executed now, which features of the current environment influence that decision, and how it should be done. Place it within a tag <subtask_reason>.
- Copy the current primitive movement from the `move_primitive` field at this step and place it exactly inside a tag <move>.
- Describe why the chosen movement should be executed now and which features of the current environment influence that decision. Place it inside a tag <move_reason>.

## Task summary

Here is a breakdown of what needs to be done:

- Describe the task.
- Describe the high-level movements that were executed, based on the completed task and the listed features.
- Describe the plan for the solution that allowed the robot to complete the task successfully.
- For each step on the trajectory, describe the reasoning that leads to determining the correct action. The reasoning should be descriptive and precise. You should provide exactly one reasoning string for each step on the trajectory specified by `trajectory_features`.
- At the very end of the response, write a single label FINISHED to indicate that the answer is complete.



## Solution

### Task summary

The task is to pick up a small object from a table and place it on a shelf. The robotic arm starts from a home position, with the gripper open. The table is located in front of the arm, at a distance of about 50 cm, and the shelf is located to the right of the table, at a distance of about 30 cm. The small object is located in the center of the table.

The high-level movements that were executed are:

1. Move the arm upwards to a height that allows the gripper to reach the table.
2. Move the arm to the left to position the gripper above the object.
3. Move the arm downwards to lower the gripper onto the object.
4. Move the arm upwards to lift the object.
5. Move the arm to the right to position the object above the shelf.
6. Move the arm downwards to lower the object onto the shelf.
